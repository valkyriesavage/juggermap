# juggermap
a map of jugger :skull:

This small repo has a handful of map markers and a simple webpage that creates an interactive Google Map from a source spreadsheet. In this case, the data are the locations of trainings for a variety of jugger clubs.

The easiest way to get up and running with it is to get a Google Maps API key (it's free and you can follow instructions here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key ), set that key to allow localhost (follow the instructions under "Restricting Keys" on the previous linked page), and fire up a local server to test it! If you adapt the page and serve it elsewhere, make sure you update your key restriction to allow calls from it (if you are hosting the map on www.example.com, be sure the key allows example.com).

If you use this code, please credit it to Valkyrie Savage and the International Jugger Council.
